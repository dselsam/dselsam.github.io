## Sketch of one possible strategy trace

### Small-\\(n\\)

- Synthesize a program that maps \\( n \\) and the maximum integer to consider \\( M \\) to a SAT formula stating that there exists \\( n \\) cards each less than \\( M \\) such that the mean-property holds
but the numbers are not all equal
- Try solving for small \\( n\\) and \\( M \\) values and make preliminary conjecture that the numbers must always be equal for all \\( n \\)

### Conjecture statement

A deck of \\( n>1 \\) cards is given.
A positive integer is written on each card.
The deck has the property that the arithmetic mean of the numbers on each pair of cards is also the geometric mean of the numbers on some collection of one or more cards.
Then all cards must be equal.

### Strategy: by contradition

Assume \\( a_1, \dotsc, a_n \\) satisfy the mean-property but are not all equal.

### Assume basic WLOG assumptions

- We can assume WLOG that \\( a_1 \geq ... \geq a_n \\)
- We can try diving by the GCD of the set. We can then pose the conjecture that we can assume this WLOG, and the proof just involves pulling the factor out of both the arithmetic and geometric means and canceling.

### Misc

- Claim: for AM of 2 numbers to equal a GM of two or more numbers, the AM needs to be integral.
  - (let's assume this is already known)

### Primes

- We can try to assume a prime divisor \\( p \\) of our biggest number \\( a_1 \\). This involves a trivial obligation that \\( a_1 > 1 \\).

- Now we know that \\( p \\) cannot divide all of them, so we can choose the first one \\( a_k \\) it does not divide.

### Construct a pair

- Consider the pair \\( a_1, a_k \\).
- The arithmetic mean is greater than \\( a_k \\).
- The geometric mean of \\( a_{i_1}, \dotsc, a_{i_\ell} \\) must be integral and must not be divisible by \\( p \\), thus must not include a single factor of \\( p \\).
- Thus it must only include numbers less than or equal to \\( a_k \\), which contradicts AM > \\( a_k \\).
