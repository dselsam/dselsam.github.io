## Sketch of one possible strategy trace

### Try a SAT solver

- realize the problem is finite
- synthesize a program that maps \\( n \\) (the number of rows) to a SAT formula
- try solving for small \\( n\\) values and estimate how long it would take to solve for 2018
- quickly realize it is hopeless

### Generalize 2018

Since we cannot solve the problem in propositional logic, we need to abstract the constant 2018
and indirect through a more general theorem.
Since 2018 does not seem to have any special properties, generalization must
consider the theorem as a function of arbitrary \\( n \\)
and hope 2018 can be used downstream.

### Small-\\(n\\)

- Using SAT solver, find multiple solutions for \\( n = 3, 4, 5 \\)
- Notice patterns
  - the set of possible roots as a function of \\( n \\):
    - \\( 3 \mapsto 1, 2, 3 \\)
    - \\( 4 \mapsto 3, 4  \\)
    - \\( 5 \mapsto 5 \\)
    - conjecture: top number must be \\( \leq n \\)
  - the biggest number always in last row
  - the set \\( 1, \dotsc, n \\) always in \\( n \\) distinct rows
  - note: with so few models, there will be countless spurious patterns/conjectures

- Look for even more elaborate patterns
  - Magically synthesize a *process*: start at top and choose biggest child recursively
    - can prove that this always exists
    - notice that it always ends up at biggest number
    - try to prove: it is the *sum* of *n* numbers, thus must be the sum of \\( 1, \dotsc, n \\)
    - this proves all three conjectures (skipping many tricky details throughout)

### Abstract the process into a program

Note that sub-triangles of anti-Pascal triangles are anti-Pascal.
We introduced a process that starts at the root of our triangle,
but we can abstract it into a program that takes an anti-Pascal triangle as input,
and that can operate on any subtriangle of our original triangle.

### Try to find quantities to optimize

Given our special permutation path, we can try to lower-bound the size of the largest downward-complete subtriangle that
does not intersect with the special path.
With some work, we can prove that this sub-triangle will have at least \\( |\pi| = (n - 2)/2 \\) rows.

### Look for contradictory bounds

In this subtriangle, the last number of the special sub-path \\( \pi \\) must be both
less than \\( \sum_{k=1}^n k = n (n+1)/2 \\) and also greater than \\( \sum_{k=1}^{|\pi|} (n+k) = |\pi|(2n + |\pi| + 1)/2 \\),
which itself is greater than \\( \frac{5n(n-2)}{8} \\).
Since plugging in \\( n=2018 \\) yields a contradiction, we are essentially done.
We wrap these two bounds into a lemma.

### Put it all together

Thus the correct statement is that no such anti-Pascal triangle holds, and we can prove it easily by plugging \\( n=2018 \\) into the lemma
above.

## Comments

- This problem solving process is ridiculously sophisticated.
It involves multiple instances of program synthesis, abstraction, generalization, verification, and very-few-shot learning.

- This process looks nothing like game-tree search. Where is the game-tree? The analogy is bogus.

- Even justifying the individual steps after they have been magically crafted is already way beyond state-of-the-art, and may be hard to even
formalize let alone automate.

- A system that could solve a new problem of this difficulty without any hand-written code, without indirecting through formal logic at all,
would be at most inches away from super-intelligence.

- Very little of the process described above is specialized to triangles, or even to combinatorics. The abstract strategies considered seem to be mostly general-purpose.
