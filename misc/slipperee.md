title:  "Slipperees"
---

Out of consideration to my neighbors, I invented a silent, zero-impact burpee alternative I call the *slipperee*. Wearing your most slippery socks:

- put your hands on the ground like you are going to start a burpee
- explosively slide your feet back
- do a push-up
- while pushing up, thrust your legs forward and slide them back to the starting position
- stand up

I estimate that it is only ~60% as difficult as a regular burpee (per repetition), but it provides the same kind of full-body burn. It is also easier to maintain good form.
