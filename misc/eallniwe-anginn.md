title:  "Ealln&iacute;we Anginn"

Here are new lyrics to the classic folk song, Auld Lang Syne.
The new title is <i>Ealln&iacute;we Anginn</i>,
which is Old English for "all new beginning"
and which we pronounce as "ee-yahl ni-way an-gine".
The lyrics foster not only celebrating the old for the sake of days gone by,
but also celebrating with the old the promise of now diverging futures.

<b>Ealln&iacute;we Anginn</b><br>
(to the tune of Auld Lang Syne)

<p>
<p>
Should auld acquaintance be forgot<br>
And never brought to mind?<br>
Should auld acquaintance be forgot<br>
For ealln&iacute;we anginn?

<p>
And surely you'll buy your pint cup<br>
And surely I'll buy mine<br>
We raise a toast to days to come<br>
For ealln&iacute;we anginn

<p>
We two have run about the slopes<br>
And picked the daisies fine<br>
But now we walk roads of our own<br>
For ealln&iacute;we anginn

<p>
We two have paddled in the streams<br>
From morning sun till dine<br>
But seas ran us to distant shores<br>
For ealln&iacute;we anginn<br>

<p>
I've held your hand my trusted friend<br>
You've held a hand of mine<br>
But let's release our hands this night<br>
For ealln&iacute;we anginn

<p>
(Chorus)<br>

For ealln&iacute;we anginn, my dear<br>
For ealln&iacute;we anginn<br>
We raise a toast to days to come<br>
For ealln&iacute;we anginn
